Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, 
leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

    Hint: “Hovering” is what happens when your mouse enters a div and ends when your mouse leaves it. 
    You can set up event listeners for either of those events as a starting point.
    There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs, including:
        adding a new class to the div.
        changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.

(Optional): Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), 
have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value. 
Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes 
is the square completely black.
